        <p>Hi, I am Daxton Tassone and I am a freshman at the University of Rhode Island. I enjoy playing sports, and mostly play soccer, lacrosse, and basketball.
            I really enjoy getting outside and being active, and sports have always been the way that I have done that. I also enjoy watching sports a lot. My 
            favorite teams to watch are the Boston Celtics, the New England Patriots, and Liverpool FC.<p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I also really enjoy animals, and have had a bunch of different pets throughout my life. I currently have a couple of dogs, a couple of cats, and a 
                horse (mostly my mom and sister's). At one point we had guinea hens which was really cool. <p>
            <p>I am a computer science major at URI, because I have always found programming to be super interesting and I have always wanted to learn it. I have 
                not been taking the class very long, but I am really enjoying it and am learning a lot! It is a lot to remember, but I'm sure that over time it will
                get easier.<p>
